## Topics to Learn

1. **Understanding the Basic Structure of a SwiftUI App**
   - Learn how SwiftUI apps are structured.
   - Explore the `@main` attribute, `App` protocol, and `Scene` lifecycle.
   - Familiarize yourself with `ContentView` as the starting point for the UI.

   - Add sections, text fields, toggles, and pickers.
   - Understand how forms automatically adapt to platform-specific designs.

3. **Adding a Navigation Bar**
   - Use `NavigationStack` to enable hierarchical navigation.
   - Add titles and buttons to the navigation bar.
   - Navigate between views programmatically or using user actions.

4. **Modifying Program State**
   - Understand the `@State` property wrapper.
   - Modify and observe state changes to update the UI dynamically.
   - Learn how state management underpins SwiftUI's declarative approach.

5. **Binding State to User Interface Controls**
   - Use `@Binding` to share state between views.
   - Bind state properties to controls like toggles, sliders, and text fields.
   - Create seamless interactions between UI elements and app logic.

6. **Creating Views in a Loop**
   - Generate lists and grids of views dynamically.
   - Explore the power of data-driven UI construction.
